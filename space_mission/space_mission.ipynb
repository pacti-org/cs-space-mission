    "This case study demonstrates using Pacti for the design and analysis of operational space mission scenarios. Normally, designing and analyzing such space missions and their scenarios involves complex simulation models covering the significant interactions that can influence the behavior of the systems involved. Several factors drive the complexity of such simulation models including the scope of subsystem interactions and the cross-domain interactions that require coordination among multiple domain experts. Is there a simpler way to explore the salient aspects of a space mission design/analysis problem than building a complex simulation? We believe that Pacti shows such a simpler approach; however, it requires switching the design paradigm from simulation-based to [contract-based](). -- TODO: cite Alberto's Frankenstein paper & Bienveniste's book.\n",
    "\n",
    "This case study focuses on the problem of operating a CubeSat-sized spacecraft/small-body asteroid rendezvous mission as described in detail in [Nesnas et al. 2021](ref5). For autonomous operation, this would involve an onboard planning/scheduling system based on a generalized timeline representation as described in [Chien et al. 2012](#ref1). Examples of such timeline representation modeling include [Rabideau et al. 2017](#ref2) and [Chen et al. 2003](#ref3). Such systems reflect deliberate design decisions to limit the expressiveness of constraint formulas for planning/scheduling due to considerations of the limited computational resources available on space mission systems and performance requirements for computing solutions. In contrast to the general class of 1st order constraint formulas of PDDL (see [Ghallab et al. 1998](#ref4)), such systems involve computationally efficient linear inequalities of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$aX <= b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is a timeline variable and $a,b$ are constants that may encode temporal information about the schedule of a task instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this class of constraint formula fits the expressiveness of Pacti's polyhedral constraints, this case study explores modeling tasks for an onboard automated planning/scheduling system as assume-guarantee components using Pacti."

    "To communicate with Earth, the cubesat-sized spacecraft (blue cube) must orient its fixed antennas towards Earth (line A). Depending on the trajectory, this orientation may be suboptimal for the spacecraft panels to produce maximum electrical power (line B). The spacecraft must make optical measurements of the small body asteroid to estimate its relative trajectory (line C) as part of the onboard autonomous navigation. This navigation requires pointing the spacecraft's thrusters in the direction of a velocity vector (line D) according to a trajectory correction maneuver (TCM). After several carefully designed TCMs, the spacecraft will eventually reach the small body asteroid and land on it as described in [Nesnas et al. 2021](ref5). For onboard planning/scheduling these behaviors would be modeled as tasks in the style of [Rabideau et al. 2017](#ref2) and [Chen et al. 2003](#ref3); that is, tasks would involve linear inequality constraints for specifying their pre/post conditions and their effects. The following describes the specification of these behaviors in Pacti's assume-guarantee paradigm."

    "For navigation, the relative trajectory estimation uncertainty grows with tasks that require spacecraft attitude changes (i.e. CHARGING, DSN, and SBO); the only way to reduce this estimation uncertainty is to perform direct optical measurements in the SBO task to refine the onboard navigation trajectory estimate. The TCM task performs so-called delta-V maneuvers calculated to improve the spacecraft's relative distance from the small body. \n",

    "While this qualitative characterization suffices to convey a sense of the phenomena involved, we need a quantitative characterization to explore the feasibility of mission scenarios from a planning/scheduling perspective and to explore different scenario strategies. The following diagram illustrates a quantitative characterization of a scenario using Pacti's polyhedral algebra for specifying assume/guarantee constraints over input/output variables. Each task instance in the scenario has a corresponding contract (e.g. A and B in the figure example). By forcing the input of a subsequent task (e.g. B) to be equal to the outputs of a previous task (e.g. A), we can thus encode a temporal ordering constraint for these tasks (i.e., B starts immediately after A finishes). Modeling task instance duration as an explicit input variable (e.g. $duration_A$), we can model quantitative linear relationships about the task behavior as a function of its duration. "
